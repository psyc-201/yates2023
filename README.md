# Composite Face Effect in Adults: A Replication Study

## Overview
This project replicates Yates & Lewkowicz (2023) to validate the composite face effect (CFE) paradigm in neurotypical adults before extending it to clinical populations.

## Original Study
**Citation:** Yates, T. S., & Lewkowicz, D. J. (2023). Robust Holistic Face Processing in Early Childhood During the COVID-19 Pandemic. Journal of Experimental Child Psychology, 105676. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2023.105676

**Research Question:** When does holistic face processing (measured by the composite face effect) emerge in typically developing children? How does masking due to the Covid-19 pandemic might influence children's face perception?

**Key Findings:** Children as young as 4 years old demonstrate the composite face effect, indicating early emergence of holistic face processing.

## Current Study

### Modifications from Original
- **Participants:** Adults (n=25) instead of children aged 4-6
- **Trials:** 96 trials instead of 36
- **Stimuli:** Grayscale faces instead of colored tints
- **Timing:** Fixed presentation (1000ms) and response windows (3000ms) instead of unlimited time
- **Additional measures:** Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2 Adult)

### Hypotheses
Adults will show a significant composite face effect, with lower accuracy on aligned-same trials compared to misaligned-same trials, demonstrating holistic face processing.
