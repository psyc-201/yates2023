Replication of Yates & Lewkowicz (2023), Journal of Experimental Child Psychology

## Current Study

### Modifications from Original
- **Participants:** Adults (n=25) instead of children aged 4-6
- **Trials:** 96 trials instead of 36
- **Stimuli:** Grayscale faces instead of colored tints
- **Timing:** Fixed presentation (1000ms) and response windows (3000ms) instead of unlimited time
- **Additional measures:** Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-2 Adult)

### Hypotheses
Adults will show a significant composite face effect, with lower accuracy on aligned-same trials compared to misaligned-same trials, demonstrating holistic face processing.
